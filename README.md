# model.MovieList

With model.MovieList you will be able to list all your movies and sort them by different categories e.g. year, genre, director....
It could be able to modify it to be generic -to list anything you want-, but that is not planed by now.
The "Test Version only" works in terminal, but there is no exception handling or entry delete ...
The final version will have a app.GUI.
Update frequently is not guaranteed.

I'm programming this for myself, if anyone will find this and could use it, feel free to do so.
